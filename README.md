# nonprofit_financial_data_explorer
Pulls together contractors data from IRS 990 forms, Checkbook NYC, and NY State Open Data to attempt to understand how nonprofit organizations in NYC work with each other, contractors, and government agencies. 

Will eventually include financial details about top contractors and the overall flow of contract funds from one organization to another.
